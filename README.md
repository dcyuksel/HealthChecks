# HealthChecks
An application utilizes numerous resources to perform its tasks, such as databases, external services, and directories. 
When an issue arises, it may not necessarily be due to the application code; it could be caused by a dependent service. 
Before investigating the problem, it is prudent to check the dependent services. Remembering and checking all dependent services can often be overlooked.

HealthChecks simplifies this process. 

By incorporating health checks, you can easily monitor the status of relevant services. 

This project demonstrates how to create, register, and display health checks.
